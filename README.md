# HexQuaerere
Pairs are from my e-c-u 
 
Use at own risk, searches nearby hex bytes in 2 pairs for any matches. 

again use at own risk..
Have not tried threading...


basically, pull the repo and run the script, should run with any python. I am using 3.8.10 with all files in the repo. 

I am just learning and trying my hand at python to find patterns in the data.
If you find a way to improve it, go ahead! part of the fun!
